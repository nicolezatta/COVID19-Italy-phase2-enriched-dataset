## Twenty-one indicators for the risk assessment

[The Italian National Institute of Health (ISS)](https://www.iss.it/web/iss-en) is the main center for research, control and technical-scientific advice on public health in Italy, thus, during covid pandemic, they are playing a central role in the Integrated Surveillance of Covid-19. This activity guides the policy orientation decisions of the Government.

During the second phase of covid pandemic in Italy, ISS monitored 21 indicators for the risk assessment, 16 of which are ‘mandatory’ and 5 optional.
These are the main reason behind the change of regions' colours, since they describe the probability of the pandemic to spread, the impact on healthcare systems and regional resilience.

Every week the ISS provides a report with all the indicators, calculated from data that are collected *regionally* and then analysed by the ISS.   

In this repository we provide the datasets with 16 of the 21 indicators from the weekly reports, in particular from week 27 (09/09/2020-15/09/2020) to week 45 (15/03/2021-21/03/2021).

Region    - 1.1%    - 1.2%    - 1.3%    - 1.4%    - 3.1 -    3.2    - 3.5    - 3.6 -    3.8% -    3.9% -    2.1% -    2.2 -    2.4 (per 10000) -    2.5(per 10000) -    2.6% -    Report

Here we provide a description for the indicators, based on their code:

***Indicators describing the system's ability to monitor the spread od pandemic***
- 1.1 Fraction of total symptomatic cases known per month of which *the day of the start of symptoms is known*;

- 1.2 Fraction of total hospitalised cases (except IC) per month with a detailed medical record, and a known date of hospitalization;
 
- 1.3 Fraction of total IC cases per month with a detailed medical record of their stay in IC, and a known date of transfer in IC;

- 1.4 Fraction of total cases per month of witch the domicile is known.

***Indicators describing the probability of the pandemic to spread***
- 3.1 Total cases reported by the Civil Protection within the last 14 days;

- 3.2 Reproduction number Rt;

- 3.5 Number of new focuses, that is to say a situation with two or more cases connected or an unexpected increasing of cases in a limited location and time;

- 3.6 Number of new cases per region, non associated with known transmission chains;

- 3.8 Rate of occupation of IC units for Covid patients;

- 3.9 Rate of occupation of hospital beds for Covid patients.

***Indicators describing the system's ability to diagnose cases and contact tracing***

- 2.1 Percentage of positive Covid tests per month, excluding, as much as possible, retesting and screening activity;

- 2.2 Time between first symptoms and diagnosis;
- 2.3 Time between first symptoms and start of isolation;
- 2.4 Number of professional figures assigned to contact-tracing;
- 2.5 Number of professional figures monitoring quarantined and isolated cases (contact tracing and testing);
- 2.6 Fraction of total cases with a detailed investigation of latest.
