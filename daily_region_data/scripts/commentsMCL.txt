This folder needs a small readme file stating the content of the folder
"this folder contains the following scripts and programs, used to process the dayly region data 


clean_colors.sh  STATE WHAT IT DOES AND WHAT INPUT / OUTPUT IT TAKES
colors_daily.csv SAME
fix_all_regions.sh. ETC
fix_region.cpp
get_all_regions.sh
get_region.sh
link_regions.cpp 

further information can be found in the heades of each script" 

the files
cleaned-dpc-covid19-ita-regioni.csv 
colors_daily.csv
are not a script so they probably should not be in the "scripts" folder - or if necessary state in the readme the purpose of these files
