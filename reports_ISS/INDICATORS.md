## Twenty-one indicators for the risk assessment

[The Italian National Institute of Health (ISS)](https://www.iss.it/web/iss-en) is the main center for research, control and scientific advice on public health in Italy. Thus, during the COVID-19 pandemic, this institute played a central role in the integrated surveillance, also guiding the Governmental policies. During the second phase of covid pandemic in Italy, ISS monitored 21 indicators for the risk assessment, 16 of which were considered ‘mandatory’ (in the sense that every region had to provide the data) and 5 optional. These indicators were the main reason behind the application of restrictions, and they were designed to describe the probability of the pandemic to spread, the impact on healthcare systems and regional resilience. Every week the ISS provides a report with all the indicators, calculated from data that are collected at the region level, and then analyzed by the ISS.   

This repository provides a compiled dataset with 16 of the 21 indicators extracted from the weekly reports, in particular from week 27 (09/09/2020-15/09/2020) to week 45 (15/03/2021-21/03/2021). 

The file header, with region and indicator code is the following. 

Region    - 1.1%    - 1.2%    - 1.3%    - 1.4%    - 3.1 -    3.2    - 3.5    - 3.6 -    3.8% -    3.9% -    2.1% -    2.2 -    2.4(per 10000) -    2.5(per 10000) -    2.6% -    Report

We provide a description of the indicators below, based on their code:

***Indicators describing the system's ability to monitor the spread of the pandemic***

- 1.1 Fraction of total symptomatic cases known per month of which *the day of the start of symptoms is known*;

- 1.2 Fraction of total hospitalised cases (except IC) per month with a detailed medical record, and a known date of hospitalization;
 
- 1.3 Fraction of total IC cases per month with a detailed medical record of their stay in IC, and a known date of transfer in IC;

- 1.4 Fraction of total cases per month of wich the domicile is known.

***Indicators describing the probability of the pandemic to spread***

- 3.1 Total cases reported by the Civil Protection within the last 14 days;

- 3.2 Reproduction number Rt;

- 3.5 Number of new outbreaks, defined as a situation with two or more cases connected or an unexpected increase of cases in a limited location and time;

- 3.6 Number of new cases per region, not associated with known transmission chains;

- 3.8 Rate of occupation of IC units for Covid patients;

- 3.9 Rate of occupation of hospital beds for Covid patients.

***Indicators describing the system's ability to diagnose cases and contact tracing***

- 2.1 Percentage of positive Covid tests per month, excluding, as much as possible, retesting and screening activity;

- 2.2 Time between first symptoms and diagnosis;

- 2.3 Time between first symptoms and start of isolation;

- 2.4 Number of professional figures assigned to contact-tracing;

- 2.5 Number of professional figures monitoring quarantined and isolated cases (contact tracing and testing);

- 2.6 Fraction of total cases with a detailed investigation.
